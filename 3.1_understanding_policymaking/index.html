                    <h2>Theories of the Group: Introduction</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public policy results from interactions among groups with different interests and resources</li>
                        <li>Understanding group interaction is key to understanding policymaking</li>
                        <li>Two main theories: elite theory and pluralist theory</li>
                        <li>These offer different perspectives on power distribution and policy formation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Elite Theory</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A small group with the most resources makes the most important decisions</li>
                        <li>These individuals are often wealthy, well-educated, and well-connected</li>
                        <li>Associated with C. Wright Mills' concept of the <em>"power elite"</em></li>
                        <li>Different elites often dominate different policy areas</li>

                    <h2>Pluralist (Group) Theory</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Power is distributed among various groups in society</li>
                        <li>Groups compete for influence over public policy</li>
                        <li>Associated with Robert Dahl's concept of <em>"polyarchy"</em></li>
                        <li>More optimistic view of power distribution</li>
                        <li>Acknowledges some groups are underrepresented in the political process</li>
