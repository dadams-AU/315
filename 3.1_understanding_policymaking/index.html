            <ul>
                <li>Public policy results from interactions among groups with different interests and resources.</li>
                <li>Understanding group interaction is key to understanding policymaking.</li>
                <li>Two main theories: elite theory and pluralist theory.</li>
                <li>These theories offer different perspectives on power distribution and policy formation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <li>A small group with the most resources makes the most important decisions.</li>
                <li>These individuals are often wealthy, well-educated, and well-connected.</li>
                <li>Associated with C. Wright Mills' concept of the "power elite".</li>
                <li>Different elites often dominate different policy areas.</li>

                <li>Groups compete for influence over public policy.</li>
                <li>Associated with Robert Dahl's concept of "polyarchy".</li>
                <li>This theory presents a more optimistic view of power distribution.</li>
