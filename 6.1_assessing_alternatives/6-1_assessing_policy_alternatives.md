---

# Slide 2: Learning Objectives
- **Describe evaluative criteria for judging the value of policy proposals or alternatives**
- **Explain how to apply the methods of policy analysis**
- **Identify three key economic approaches to policy analysis**
- **Distinguish between several kinds of decision-making and impact analysis**
- **Compare the ethical approach of policy analysis against other methods**

**Opening Question**: *"When you think of COVID-19 policies, what comes to mind?"*

---

# Slide 3: Evaluative Criteria for Judging Policy Proposals
- **Evaluative criteria** are the specific dimensions of policy objectives used to weigh policy options or judge the merits of existing policies or programs.
  1. They act as **justifications or rationales** for policy or government action.
  2. The use of explicit criteria establishes **clear standards** that keep analysis objective and focused.

---

# Slide 4: Evaluative Criteria for Judging Policy Proposals
- Policy debates often involve multiple, competing criteria:
  1. Policymakers want policy actions to be **effective**, but also:
    - **Minimize costs**.
    - **Promote equity**.
    - **Maintain individual rights**.
  2. Analysts must determine which criteria are most important and **rank policy alternatives** accordingly.

---

# Slide 5: Evaluative Criteria - Effectiveness
- **Criterion**: **Effectiveness**
  - **Definition**: Likelihood of achieving policy goals.
  - **Limitations**: Involves **uncertain projection** of future events.
  - **Example**: Evaluating how effective lockdowns were in controlling COVID-19 spread.

---

# Slide 6: Evaluative Criteria - Efficiency
- **Criterion**: **Efficiency**
  - **Definition**: Achieving goals relative to **costs**.
  - **Limits**: Difficult to measure all costs/benefits; **political decisions** play a role.
  - **Example**: Analyzing the efficiency of vaccine distribution programs during the pandemic.

---

# Slide 7: Evaluative Criteria - Equity
- **Criterion**: **Equity**
  - **Definition**: **Fairness** in distributing costs and benefits.
  - **Limits**: Difficult to measure; disagreements over **fair process** vs. **equal outcomes**.
  - **Example**: Assessing vaccine distribution for vulnerable communities.

---

# Slide 8: Evaluative Criteria - Liberty/Freedom
- **Criterion**: **Liberty/Freedom**
  - **Definition**: Extent of impact on **privacy** and individual rights.
  - **Limits**: Clouded by **ideological beliefs**.
  - **Example**: Mask mandates and lockdowns during COVID-19.

---

# Slide 9: Evaluative Criteria - Political Feasibility
- **Criterion**: **Political Feasibility**
  - **Definition**: Likelihood of policy **support** from elected officials.
  - **Limits**: Depends on **economic and political conditions**.
  - **Example**: Varied support for vaccination mandates across regions.

---

# Slide 10: Evaluative Criteria - Social Acceptability
- **Criterion**: **Social Acceptability**
  - **Definition**: Extent of **public acceptance**.
  - **Limits**: Hard to gauge even with data; depends on **issue saliency**.
  - **Example**: Public reactions to mask mandates during the pandemic.

---

# Slide 11: Evaluative Criteria - Administrative Feasibility
- **Criterion**: **Administrative Feasibility**
  - **Definition**: Likelihood of effective **implementation** by agencies.
  - **Limits**: Requires projecting **resources** and agency capabilities.
  - **Example**: Logistical feasibility of mass vaccination campaigns.

---

# Slide 12: Policy Analysis Methods
- **Policy Analysis Methods** often draw from **economics**:
  - **Cost–Benefit Analysis** (CBA)
  - **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis** (CEA)
- Emphasize **efficiency**, but useful for nontechnical analyses as well.
- Example: **CBA** of lockdowns—costs vs. reduction in cases.

---

# Slide 13: Policy Evaluation Beyond Economics
- Policy analysis involves:
  - **Effectiveness**, **Equity**, **Liberty/Freedom**, **Political Feasibility**.
- COVID-19 policy debates illustrated the difficulty of balancing these criteria.
- Ultimately, **decision-making** lies with **policymakers** and the **public**.

---

# Slide 14: Economic Approaches to Policy Analysis
- **Public policies** require resources; economic analysis helps understand real costs.
  - Helps weigh **trade-offs** between alternatives.
- Criticism: Overemphasis on **dollar values** may **neglect societal needs**.
- Example: COVID-19 relief packages—balancing economic costs with public health benefits.

---

# Slide 15: Understanding Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
- **Steps** in CBA:
  1. **Identify** short/long-term costs and benefits.
  2. **Monetize** tangible values.
  3. Apply a **discount rate** for future values.
  4. Consider **qualitative** factors.
  5. **Aggregate** results.
- Example: Evaluating benefits and costs of mass testing campaigns.

---

# Slide 16: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)
- Used when **benefits** aren't easily monetized.
- Compares **relative value** of different options.
- Example: Comparing investments in vaccines vs. contact tracing during COVID-19.

---

# Slide 17: Introduction to Risk Assessment
- **Risk Assessment** estimates risks (e.g., pandemics).
  - **Risk (R)** = **Probability (p)** × **Consequences (C)**
  - Used to understand public risk during COVID-19.
- **Public Perception** vs. **Expert Evaluation**: Perception often drove risk-related decisions.

---

# Slide 18: Political and Institutional Approaches
- **Political Feasibility Analysis**:
  - Gauges **support** from officials and stakeholders.
  - Example: Varied adoption of COVID-19 restrictions based on political context.

---

# Slide 19: Conclusion
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Evaluative criteria are critical for policy analysis.
  - Economic methods like **CBA** and **CEA** are useful but have limitations.
  - COVID-19 illustrated the need to balance **effectiveness**, **equity**, and **freedom**.
  - **Political feasibility** and **public involvement** are essential for successful implementation.

**Final Question**: *"If you were a policymaker during COVID-19, which criterion would you prioritize?" (Effectiveness, Equity, Liberty/Freedom)*
